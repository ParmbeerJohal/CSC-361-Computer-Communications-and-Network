# Computer-Communications-and-Network

## Course Overview
The course is an introduction to data communication networks and the design and architecture of TCP/IP protocol stack, which empowers the Internet that connects "everything" and "everyone". The topics covered are all about the TCP/IP protocol stack, including the Application, Transport, Network and Link layers.

## Topics:
- Introduction
  - Internet overview
  - Network technologies and structures
  - Packet and Circuit Switching
  - Network architectures, services and protocols

- Application layer
  - Client-server model
  - World-Wide Web (WWW)
  - Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  - Domain Name System (DNS)
  - Email (POP3/SMTP)
  - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  - Socket Application Programming Interface

- Transport layer
  - Transport layer services
  - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  - TCP connection management techniques
  - TCP flow, error and congestion control

- Network layer
  - Network layer services
  - Internet Protocol (IP)
  - IP Addressing and Forwarding Tables
  - Routers and Switches
  - Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  - Autonomous Systems
  - Basic routing algorithms: distance vector and link state
  - Internet routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP)

- Link layer
  - Link layer services
  - Link layer error and flow control techniques
  - Medium Access Control (MAC) techniques
  - Link layer interworking techniques

## Assignments
1. Assignment 1 deals with socket programming (in python) using TCP connections.
2. Assignment 2 deals with setting up a client-server model and testing the model using pings.
3. Assignment 3 deals with using a simple mail transfer protocol to send an email to the desired email address.
